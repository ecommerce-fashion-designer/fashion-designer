# 404 Fashion E-Commerce Site

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue)


## Description

We wanted to build an online fashion boutique e-commerce site that would allow visitors to view a range of clothing items and accessories for men and women and for them to be able to purchase these items with ease. Our platform was built with a range of technologies that we have learnt thus far in our coding bootcamp. As a collective, we learned a great deal about collaboration and teamwork as well as the interplay between the numerous technologies we chose to employ.
